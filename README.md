# SmartNextOcurrence

I decided to create this, to turn development easier and optimized like tools wich exists on another tools, like a [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

This extension allow to put an caret/cursor on next ocurrence of an selected word in Visual Studio.

With **Ctrl+D** hotkeys you can create a new cursor on next ocurrence of the same selected word.

Look those imagens to see how it works ;D
